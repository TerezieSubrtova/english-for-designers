01 About me:
Since childhood, I have loved drawing and creating. What
started as a hobby with a pencil and paper grew into a
deep passion for graphic design.
I’ve always been fascinated by videos like 5-Minute Crafts,
DIY tutorials, and similar ones. I loved trying to recreate
what I saw in those videos. Of course, most of the ideas
that looked amazing on screen were impossible to make in
real life, and instead of a finished product, I usually ended
up with a big mess. (Sorry, mom...) But I absolutely loved it,
and my parents quickly realized that I was a creative soul
destined to take an artistic path sooner or later.

02 About me/my style:
I believe design can tell stories, spark emotions, and
bring people together – and that’s what I enjoy most
about my work.
I specialize in minimalist design, where less is more.
Clean lines and neutral tones create harmony and
clarity. At the same time, I love to experiment – bold
colors and expressive styles allow me to give each
project its own unique energy and personality.
Every project is an opportunity to create something
special that reflects not only my passion for design
but also your vision and values.
