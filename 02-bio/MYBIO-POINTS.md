From a young age, I have loved creating, painting, and drawing.
Art has always been a big part of my life. This passion led me to study it and now I want to make it my career.

In graphic design, I focus on minimalism and clarity. I like to use light, neutral colors that make my designs feel calm and elegant. 
Typography is very important to me because it adds neatness and structure. I also enjoy playing with colors and bold styles to make my work unique and lively.

I aim to provide each client with a custom solution, creating visuals that strengthen their brand and connect with their audience.
