**THE STORY OF AN (ALMOST TOO) SENSITIVE DESIGNER**

I'm a graphic design student, I have three jobs, and more emotions than a Spotify playlist. And all of that shapes my work.

**HI, IT'S ME.**

On the outside, I seem like a quiet, calm, and sweet little soul. Sometimes, people mistake me for a little girl and ask me for my ID card for a non-alcoholic beer.

When something really pisses me off, people mistake me for a Chihuahua. Small but noisy. And that pisses me off even more.

**EMPATHY AS A SUPERPOWER (NOT ALWAYS AN ADVANTAGE)**

I'm the kind of person who would take home every lonely kitten, cries
during TV shows, and feels sorry for almost everything. I'd probably also
adopt every old person who eats lunch alone.

Being sensitive is a big part of who I am – but it’s not always easy.
Because of that, it’s hard for me to say no. And I’ve paid the price for it
more than once. People quickly take advantage when you’re too kind
and when you don’t know how to speak up for yourself.

I can’t say no to clients, I don’t know how to ask for
fair money for my work, and I often say yes to new
things, even when I already have too much to do.
I often put others first… and forget about myself.
I can’t even say no to my mum when she still calls
the doctor for me. And yes – she really still does
that.

But this soft side of me doesn’t make my work
worse. I would never finish something just to be
done with it. Even when I have many things to do
and my head is full, I always give my best. I want to
feel proud of what I make.

And maybe this is what helps me in design. I put
heart, feeling, and real care into every project.
I believe design is not just about how something
looks – it’s also about understanding people. Good
design is not only useful and nice, but also full of
emotion. It’s human.

**THREE JOBS, THREE WORLDS**

**Gastronomy** - *love and hell*

I grew up in a gastronomy business.

Working with people is hard, but it taught
me a lot about attitude, empathy, handling
pressure, and that the customer is always
right – even when they are not.

It is the hardest job I know. Mentally difficult,
full of stress, crying in the bathroom... but
I still love it and I think it moves me a lot from
a human perspective.

Working with people shaped me more than
any school.

**Graphic** *from home*

I create illustrations based on photos, which are
then engraved into plexiglass plates and
illuminated with a base. The result is a personal
lamp – a light with a story. It is precise, slow work,
but extremely fulfilling.

And in the process, you acquire patience, care
and a sense of composition.

**PR agency** *and my invisibility*

In my third job, I help a company with clients
and social media. I enjoy getting to know
different brands and worlds. But... the
visuals are submitted under the agency's
name. The client doesn't even know it was
me. And I want to stand up for my work.
To be more than just an anonymous hand.

But it's a useful practice and an idea of how
communication with clients works and what
you have to face.

**MY GRAPHIC DESIGN SOUL**
I love minimalism and every detail – clean, calm,
without unnecessary things. But at the same time,
I am also attracted to contrasting, expressive styles.

Sometimes two aesthetics clash within me –
on the one hand, a white, clean interior, and on the
other, colorful hippie chaos. And I love both.

In graphics, I enjoy working with contrasts the most,
illustrations, and things that are simple but have an
idea. I love working with shapes, colors, and rhythm.
I am a perfectionist, and thanks to my job, where I
convert photos into vectors every day, where every
curved pixel matters, I have an eye for detail.

**WHAT I LEARNED**

**About myself:** think first of all about myself and
my mental health, be self-confident, learn to say
no, be able to give myself an appropriate reward,
and stop underestimating myself.

Even a small Chihuahua can have a big voice and
that empathy is not a weakness, but a superpower.

**About my work:** I learned that even though I am
a sensitive soul, I can work hard – and with my heart.

That design is not just about beauty, but about
empathy, stories and the courage to create
something personal.
